*DESCRIPTION * :
The given frontend code represents a simple and interactive quiz web application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a basic quiz platform titled "CODTECH Quiz", allowing users to test their general knowledge across multiple questions. The structure is divided into three main sections: the HTML markup, the CSS for styling, and the JavaScript for functionality and interactivity.

In the HTML section, the webpage is structured with a quiz-container div that holds the main content. This includes a heading for the quiz title, a container to display questions and answers, a button for navigating to the next question, and a paragraph tag for displaying the score. The background of the page is set using an inline style that loads an image from a local directory (./images/image.jpg.jpeg). The HTML also includes external references to a CSS file (style.css) and a JavaScript file (script.js), which define the appearance and behavior of the quiz respectively.

The CSS code, which is embedded below the HTML, defines the visual aesthetics of the page. The overall background color of the body is set to a soft bluish tone, although it’s overridden by the background image. The quiz container is centrally aligned, styled with a purple background (blueviolet), rounded corners, padding, and a subtle shadow to make it stand out. Answer buttons are styled to be responsive, occupying the full width and enhancing readability with a larger font size. Additional styling is added using two CSS classes: correct and wrong, which color the selected answer green or red respectively, based on whether the answer is right or wrong.

The JavaScript code is where the interactivity of the quiz is implemented. It begins by defining a questions array, which holds multiple question objects. Each object contains a question string and an array of answer choices, each with a text and a Boolean flag indicating whether it's the correct answer. The script keeps track of the current question index and the user’s score. Functions are defined to manage the quiz flow: startQuiz() initializes the quiz, showQuestion() loads the current question and possible answers, and resetState() clears the previous question’s state. When a user selects an answer, the selectAnswer() function highlights all answers in green or red to indicate correctness and disables further selections.

The nextButton triggers either the loading of the next question or the display of the final score using the showScore() function. After all questions are completed, the final score is shown with an option to restart the quiz using a button that reinitializes the entire process. Overall, the code is simple and effective, offering a clean user interface and intuitive functionality. It serves as a good foundation for a beginner-level quiz application, with possibilities for enhancement such as adding a timer, categories, or more dynamic styling.
